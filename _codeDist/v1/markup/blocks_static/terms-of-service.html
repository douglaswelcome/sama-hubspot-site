            </p>
            <p>
                The sama Service shall be available and running 99.5% of the time. If such availability service
                level
                is not met during the subscription term under an Order, Customer shall be eligible for a service credit
                as
                described below.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Unavailability</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The sama Service will be considered unavailable when it is inaccessible during two or more
                consecutive
                90-second intervals. Availability for the Service for the relevant time period will be calculated as the
                fraction of Customer’s Service requests that are failing worldwide. Uptime in a month will be calculated
                across the Service under each Order based on the uptime of the Service used during the month, weighted
                by
                the fraction of all service requests accounted for during that month. For purposes of this availability
                service level, a "month" means a calendar month.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Service Credits</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Service credits are calculated as a percentage of the total subscription fees Customer is charged each
                month
                under the applicable Order (or Customer’s annual fees divided by 12) as follows:
                Total Available Uptime (across all subscribed Services under an Order) per month and the associated
                service
                credit:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>100% - 99.5% - 0% Credit Amount;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>99.49% - 99% - 10% Credit Amount; or</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Less than 99% - 25% Credit Amount</p>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To receive a service credit, Customer must contact sama in writing within 30 days following the
                end of
                the unavailability via email at legal@sama.com and include the dates and times of unavailability.
                Provided that sama confirms that the uptime percentage in a month covered by the request is below
                99.5%, sama will issue Customer the applicable service credit. Service credits (i) may be applied
                to
                any future invoice issued by sama to Customer (including renewals, subsequent Orders and
                overages),
                (ii) cannot be exchanged for, or converted to, monetary compensation, and (iii) will expire if not used
                within twelve (12) months of being issued. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the maximum
                service credit that shall be issued for downtime in a month is 25% of the fees charged for that month.
                This SLA is Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy (and sama’s sole liability) for unavailability of
                the sama Service.</p>
            <p><b>Limitations</b></p>
            <p>
                Unavailability due to the following instances is not included in the available uptime service level
                calculation, and will not count towards unavailability calculations for purposes of service credits:
